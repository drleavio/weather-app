setup the project
1-> clone the repositry
2-> run the command cd weather-app
3-> run the command npm install
4-> set your own environment variables like supabase anon key and openweathermap api key
5-> run the project by npm run dev

Approach to project
I break the problem in small sub problems
like firstly I have to acheive authentication and authorisation logic for that I used supabase which makes this part very easy for me
after the authentication is done I worked on the restrictions of pages like which page to shown to whom and when which was also easy
for such 2-3 pages of website.

now the final part was to integrate the weather api for which I have taken so much time because the documentation was not good enough also I have to take some references from other platforms for undrestanding the api well and the query which i have to pass on to api

and lastly I have tried to beautify the website like its colors and responsivness using tailwind
